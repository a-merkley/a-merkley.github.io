I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University advised by [Dr. Pulkit Grover](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~pgrover/). My research is at the intersection of machine learning, information theory, and neuroscience. I develop both theoretical and machine learning models to understand communication in noisy, high-dimensional neural data. Previously, I received Bachelor's degrees in Computer Engineering and Mathematics at Colorado State University in 2020.

<!-- Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.  -->
